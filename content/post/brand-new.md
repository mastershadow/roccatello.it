Welcome to a revamped version of my personal website.

Probably I would never populate the old content back, so let's start from scratch (also because a lot of previous content were pretty lame).

Technically speaking this version doesn't use a CMS. I've chosen Hugo as a static website generator as I've a very little time to dedicate to upgrading and managing my personal wordpress installation and I really do not want to be hacked by automatic bots.

Hugo is really a nice piece of software. It is written in Go and content could be managed using Markdown.
Also it is integrable with static CMS like Forestry but I didn't tried yet.

I'm going to publish on this website all the experiments I've in my mind. So stay tuned :rocket:
