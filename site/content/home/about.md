# Su di me

# About me

I'm Eduard Roccatello, the Chief Technology Officer of 3DGIS, an Italian GIS company.
I love working on innovative solutions: things that _change the status quo about spatial data development and usage_.

My day is usually full of math and big data and I like to be surrounded by interesting and skilled people. I also really do care about user experience and software usability.

Leading 3D geospatial R&D at 3DGIS, I've leart to manage hard tasks with difficult timelines on a daily basis.
I'm also the lead software architect of the Cityvu project and a long time developer of the Xfce Desktop Environment.
