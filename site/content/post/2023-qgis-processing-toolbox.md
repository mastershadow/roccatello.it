In this episode I'll show you how to use the **PROCESSING TOOLBOX** in QGIS and how to use the **EXTRACT BY LOCATION** algorithm to extract features from one layer using the geometric information from another one using a geospatial predicate (well it's easier to do than to explain).

This is also called query using spatial relations.

## What is QGIS?

QGIS is a professional GIS application that is built on top of and proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
