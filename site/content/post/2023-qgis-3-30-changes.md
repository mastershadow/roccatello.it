Let's see what has been introduced in QGIS 3.30: features, improvements and a breaking change about project compatibility.

From the QGIS official changelog:
The 3.30 ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch release of the groundbreaking QGIS project introduces a wide range of changes and optimizations from the QGIS developer community. 

The splash screen features a fragment of the ‚ÄúGemeentekaart‚Äù, or Municipality map, of ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch from 1867. It is part of a series of 1200 maps of all the communities in The Netherlands from that time, which were published in an atlas for each of the 11 regions
