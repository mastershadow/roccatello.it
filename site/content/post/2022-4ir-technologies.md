We are facing the Fourth Industrial Revolution (or 4IR): a process that conceptualizes rapid change to technology, industries, and societal patterns and processes in the 21st century.

In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include internet of things, cloud computing, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence.

The world is already moving along with 4IR but what is moving and pushing forward the revolution?

A great push is coming from Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. These technologies are already considered the drivers of the current industrial revolution but while Cloud Computing and Internet of Things are new but consolidated, other technologies are just a bit more than a newborn.

Artificial intelligence will be a game changer, alongside robotics and real time data collection for exploration of unknown places. **Location** will be very important for global progress, given now base maps are mandatory for a lot of applications.
Also metaverse, and augmented / mixed reality, pratically does not exist but will be a reality in just a few years.

Always remember this:

> Revolutions bring change. Embracing change leads to disruption. Disruption creates opportunities.
