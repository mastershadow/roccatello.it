Do you know how the GPS works? The global positioning system uses a few math tricks to compute your location in space.

I will explain you the concepts behind it and how to import GPX file into QGIS so you can import your running, hiking, biking tracks without any sort of issue.

üõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏èüõ∞Ô∏è A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows satellite navigation devices to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites.
