## TEXT DELIMITED FILES‚ùì
A text delimited file is a file which contains data organized per rows and columns, in order to build a data storage structure.
The two most common file types are CSV, which uses a comma as separator and TSV, which uses a tabulation as separator. Separator characters are usually escaped if contained in data and fields may be surrounded by double quotes. Also you may have column names in the first row of the file.
Text delimited files are a common way to import / export data from many software.
