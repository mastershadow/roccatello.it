Some days ago I've switched from Wordpress to Hugo, as I was looking for a zero maintenance solution after deploy.

But Wordpress is a very versatile CMS and that's why I was looking for a static CMS for Hugo.  
After looking for a while I've found Forestry and I'm giving it a try. This is the first post using this system.

Also I've moved website source to GitHub :smile:
