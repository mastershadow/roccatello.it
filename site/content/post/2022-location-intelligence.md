Collecting data about something is the kind of activity you would love to do without too much effort on you side.
Location data collection has always been very costly but things are changing.

Technologic advance has brought us a wide range of small, cost effective, and powerful devices, which are location capable and can carry a wide range of sensors.

Just think about what you have in your pocket: a powerful computer which capable to know its location, in almost every moment.
You smartphone can actually do a lot with location data, as it is able to manipulate data and show you results in real time (that's why I'm developing carto.app :-).

Think about making your pocket device smaller and energy efficient: you will obtain a small device, which is location aware with enough power and connectivity to do almost everything.

The increasing importance of big data and AI applications is a killer application for location data: together can surely add value insights
