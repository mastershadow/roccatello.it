## What is a Global Navigation System?

A satellite navigation system a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning.

It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few centimeters to metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites.

A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a **global navigation satellite system (GNSS)**.

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 18â€“30 medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital planes.
