In this tutorial about QGIS 3 I'll show you two useful operators for vector data: UNION and INTERSECT.

## Union vs Intersection

In GIS, a union is an analytical process in which the features from two or more map layers are combined into a single, composite layer. Union includes the data from all the included layers, meaning that overlapping and non-overlapping areas are included in a new polygon.

An Intersect is an analytical operation that can be used to select any part of a feature that intersects with one or more other features. The areas of the map where all the input features intersect will create a feature as the intersect output.

## üî¥ What is QGIS?

QGIS is a professional GIS application that is built on top of and proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
