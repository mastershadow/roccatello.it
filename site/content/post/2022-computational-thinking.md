Your programmer skills are made of concepts and reasoning you could apply them to real life problems. This could be the key to solve problems in all areas and this is called **Computational Thinking**.

Practically speaking, computational thinking is a way to express a problem to a computer, that will be able to solve. You may think it is what, nowadays, is called AI or Machine Learning but its origin is before AI was really an option.

> Computational thinking is like data science: everybody does it but no-one could explain exactly what is it.

### The foundation of Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition

#### Data representation

#### Abstraction

#### Algorithms
